  We don’t seem to experience first-hand experiences with God all of the time.
  Some of those times we do get that chance are when we’re open, accepting, and
  willing.

The other night I got to experience God through writing.

Everyone was in bed and I was quietly writing on my new Pixelbook (more than awesome Google tablet/laptop) for my ‘Awakening Journal’.

As I was writing, I knew the beginning was coming from me. Pushing for the words to come out and trying my best to hear God speak onto \[virtual] paper.

The following is the result of this writing. Notice how at one point the terms change to ‘me’ instead of my third person talk about God.

> Yes, I know someone out there is as skeptical as I would be reading something like this. But, I’m being honest here. What you will read is me writing, but God leading the pen.

All of your life has been about you. It’s been about what you’d like to wear, what your favorite thing is to eat, and what your favorite color is.

These are whatever draw you to believe the best things about you make you your best person.

Do you know what truly makes you your best person?

When you become outward focused. Not the inward focused person you’ve been, but the one that sees how it all fits together.

Here’s the most fascinating part:

Life in its most precious and non-precious forms give meaning. Both the small and large things show the way our world is meant to exist.

God created not only the beautiful for us to adore, but also the ugly.

Most of the things we think about tend to come from our innate ability to want to further ourselves.

* What is the best career I can choose?
* What are the best personal goals I can set?
* Where can I find the best woman?

This shouldn’t be sugar coated — too many of us don’t focus our eyes on the outward. Let’s focus on things that help others and give our life meaning.

Maybe re-word the previous questions.

* What career can I best use my talents to further other’s lives?
* Are my goals aligned with where God is leading my life?
* How can I best satisfy the woman that gives me a chance?

It’s not about you. It’s about them.

About love.

About the people’s lives only you can change.

Do you know this? Do you know how important they are?

Mothers. Fathers. Children. Teachers, construction workers, fast-food workers.

Families. Siblings. Grieving parents. Grieving children.

Life serves a higher purpose. A calling. A reason to be here.

Seek it. Follow it.

Don’t ignore the signs — the “coincidences”. There is not a such thing as a coincidence. It’s not an accident you decided to watch that movie this past weekend that seemed to be directly aimed at your heart. Not by chance did you eat a piece of Dove chocolate and on the wrapper the words, “This story has so much more to be told.”

Stop being naive; don’t say no to the thing you need to say yes to.

Keep me in your heart. Keep me in your prayers. The world did not come into existence without a reason. You were put here for a reason. That reason being your ultimate calling.

To most, they don’t even get the chance to see what they are capable of. They deny me in the flesh from the moment they’re born all the way until they die.

What a shame. Only a small amount of people earn their full potential through both love and fear.

The experiences they go through teach them. From the very first child all the way up to the very last breath, they understand what they are supposed to do before they even do it.

Don’t let all of this come back to you; because, remember — IT’S NOT ABOUT YOU!

IT’S ABOUT ME.

Signed,\
God
