  This is the first time in over a year that Iâ€™ve been more than 48 hours
  without my medicine. It has come to this decision based on my mood and
  relationship with my wife, Whitney.

Here are some things Iâ€™ve noticed:

* Iâ€™m a more positive person.
* my mood better throughout the day.

My side effects have definitely disappeared! This includes less dry mouth, less headaches and better bowel movements ðŸ™‚

Itâ€™s weird how you notice things more when you make a significant change in your lifeâ€¦

Iâ€™m not here to say that this will be the last time I take my medicine, but itâ€™s made me think about the benefits vs. not taking it.

Some repercussions to deal with will be talking to my doctor and drug testing. Since many others in the world have ruined it for us law-abiding citizens.

I want to write a follow-up to this that talks about other things and the thought process. A couple of things Iâ€™m worried about are:

* withdrawals (because itâ€™s a controlled substance)
* options without it
* other ways to focus

Thatâ€™s it for this one â€” enjoy your day!
