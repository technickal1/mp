  It’s been a long while. Studying the web, listening to podcasts, watching
  videos, listening to more podcasts, watching more videos and taking
  educational based courses from places like Udemy.

What’s this done for me?

Caused an information overload. It’s sort of like a state of paralysis. You have so much information around you, albeit, great information. But, it causes this paralysis state where it’s just plain difficult for you to get anything done.

THE TRUTH ABOUT STARTING

The truth is – I’ve been trying for about the past two years to start an online-based business and it has caused much frustration, jealousy, barely any success, and time away from family.

I’ve been frustrated because I’ve learned the steps but implementing them have led me to compare myself with other sites online.

There’s been jealousy because of the other people succeeding, but my things online have gone nowhere.

The time away from family will never come back and I’ve got to figure out a way to focus more often on the things that need to be finished.

At this point, there are many things that I’ve started on, but not yet finished.

WHAT ARE THE UNFINISHED THINGS?

* 75% of a 100-page book
* Half of an e-course on Udemy teaching others how to become more productive with Trello
* Other ideas for online businesses including:
  * lawn niche website
  * tech niche website
  * christian-based website
  * YouTube channel
  * training courses for learning online marketing skills

But, on the other hand, I’ve picked up many skills — many of which I loved to learn and will never look back (or regret) the decisions that have been made along the way.

A QUICK LIST OF SKILLS GAINED

* I’m fluent in Photoshop (in other words, I know it very well)
* I consider myself farther than advanced in the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and others)
* My WordPress knowledge and experience is extensive
* I can tell you how to run a successful website including monetization, website creation, and keyword research
* some other “jack-of-all-trades” type of talents

Along the journey, there’s been an incredible mental process going on in my head. It plays out something like this:

I’ve got the same amount of technical expertise as the majority of these people out there. Why am I not succeeding?

I know the answer. And, to others, it was (and is) probably obvious.

There is too much time on my end spent _studying _others instead of _learning _from others.

It’s a great thing we have on the web. The ability to see the hows and whys of everything that’s working. There’s a bunch of people teaching people how to make money on the internet. To an extent, I find that it’s okay (in my opinion) to do.

But, for people like me, we get caught up in the [analysis paralysis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffboss/2015/03/20/how-to-overcome-the-analysis-paralysis-of-decision-making/#670aba781be5) phase of learning. I move on to the next phase.

Frozen.

Frozen from doing anything but learning, and learning, and more learning.

To talk more about this, I’m going to start from where I first had the idea of trying to earn money online.

There’s always been this notion inside of me that it’s possible to make money on the internet. After all — there’s advertisements, special links, businesses working together, and all kinds of other nonsense going on over the web.

The issue was, there was not a know-how solution.

Isn’t that where we get stuck? In the starting phase? If we don’t know what to do, then typically, we don’t do it.

MORE OF THE STORY – PASSIVE INCOME DISCOVERY

Somehow I found out about the term passive income. What is passive income?

Well, the guy who says it best is Pat Flynn over at [smartpassiveincome.com](smartpassiveincome.com).

I found out about Pat somewhere around late 2014, possibly 2015 – I don’t exactly remember. But, it created inspiration/motivation for me. He \[Pat] lives a great example of what it means to be an average guy who discovered the wonders of how to make a living on the web.

Now, not all of the earning-money-on-the-internet techniques are for everyone. There are simply people who desire to work in a locally based environment with the typical 8-5 or 9-5 hours. For me, that’s just not so.

It’s not about having a terrible boss that breathes down your neck, or the financial aspect, or even the hours per say. I’ve worked with exceptional leaders in different industries and they are right where they need to be. Teaching and leading others in their markets.

What it ultimately comes down to (for me) is the freedom.

The freedom to spend time with the kids on my own schedule.

The freedom to pursue endeavors as often (or whatever type) when I choose to.

The freedom to teach my skills, benefit others, and become a resource without having to “follow the ways” the world teaches.

Once I discovered what types of freedoms I could look forward to, I knew that this was the lifestyle I wanted to pursue. Being careful about not taking all the time away from my kids was (and still is) the hard part.

It’s a tough call — put all your effort into work that hopefully will allow you to live the lifestyle you want — or potentially lose much time with your kids and other parts of your family and friends.

What would you choose?

DEFINING YOUR PURPOSE IN LIFE

Seriously. What are you doing with your life if you’re just making it on cruise control?

Are you happy?

Are you actually in control of your life, or is your life in control of you? Your job, your finances, your bills.

It’s time to figure out your purpose if you haven’t.

In an effort to try and make sense of this thing we call life, I’m going to be sharing my journey with you.

MOVING FORWARD

I’m going to have a section on my blog/business called revenue report. In this report, it’s going to list any means of income I’ve made — monthly. These will go back to before this post, and many of you will probably laugh. But, that’s okay. I want to be honest and transparent so that anyone else who feels this is impossible might just try it too.

There are many other bloggers out there like Pat Flynn, Pinch of Yum, Abby from Just a Girl and Her Blog, and Matthew from matthewwoodward.co.uk, just name a few who publish monthly income reports. I’m doing things just a tad different by using the term revenue instead of income.

Same meaning, different terminology.

Once you start seeing these sites across the web, you really understand the amount of freedom available to many people that have the skills to be out there as a resource.

But, there is still hard work. All of these people on the internet still have to put many hours in and have become an expert in whatever they promote. Over time, this happens. And, I’m going to keep pushing forward until I get there.

See you in the next post!
