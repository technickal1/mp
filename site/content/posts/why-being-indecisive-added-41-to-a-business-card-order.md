## Why Can I Not Just Make A Decision?

I'm a very indecisive person. If you know anything about me, then you probably know this by now. I started meeting with a networking group in Anderson and I was told to "bring about 25 business cards" with me in order to pass them out with the group. 

The problem was that I was going through this whole branding phase with my brand and I couldn't decide what I wanted on the business cards. 

What should it say? 

* _MP Media Production _
* _MP Production & Design _
* _MP Media_
* _MP Video Production _
* _MP Media Design_
* _or about 10 others... _

As you will see in the pictures below, I ended up with_ MP Production and Design. _Since the services I offer are for Video **Production** and Website **Design,** and my business is registered under **Mastering Purpose,** it seemed appropriate. 

The problem I faced (and still continue to) was that I just felt it wasn't right. 

_...It doesn't sound right... _

_...I need to design the card differently... _

_...The font is too small..._

It seems that I'll never be happy with my results. I'm the one that designed the card after spending **hours** on it! But, why am I not happy with it? That's because I'm the one that went from start to finish with it. I'm the one that made the conscious decision to take a smaller card size and run with it instead of the traditional business card size. I'm also the one that picked the quote to go on the back, picked the colors, changed the weights (thickness) of the fonts, etc. etc. etc.

**Starting A Business That Matters**

Starting this whole business thing is constantly making me take action instead of being perfect. So, what happened when I passed the cards out? Well, I received a couple compliments about the size, the uniqueness, and also how those with bad eyesight couldn't read the bottom line. 

Here's what the text says on the card:

\----------------------------------------------------- \
**Hey, I'm Nick Henry.** \
MP **Production & Design** \
nick@masteringpurpose.com • 765.617.6097 \

The card I had before this was different and the next card I make (or outsource for that matter) may be different. But, that could hurt me. Or, it could help me. That's the part about indecisiveness - is that a word? You've got to just _decide!_

**Make A Decision and Live With It**

Take the moment when your brain starts telling you, "Oh well, screw it, just do it!" Otherwise, you'll be spending hours -- and I'm not exaggerating -- trying to decide and go over what's already been gone over about 10 times already. What I'm trying to say is, if I would have just [made a couple decisions](http://lifehacker.com/four-tricks-to-help-you-make-any-difficult-decision-987762341) in advance, I could have ordered the cards and skipped the expedited shipping fee. First, let's break down the total of the entire shipment:

| Description                     | Price    |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| Mini Business Card (50)         | $16.15   |
| Material 15pt Card Stock        |          |
| Front coat: soft-touch laminate | **FREE** |
| Back coat: soft-touch laminate  | **FREE** |
| Subtotal                        | $16.15   |
| SHIPPING                        | $41.00   |
| Sale Pricing                    | $-6.80   |
| TOTAL                           | $50.35   |

\
Something looks wrong with that to me. Do you see it? Just in case you don't, the business cards themselves actually **only cost $9.35!** Nine dollars. And thirty-five cents. That's 18.7 cents per card. The shipping was $41.00 by itself. But, you know what? I was okay with that. Most would say that they'd wait to order, get different cards, etc. 

My thoughts [are still that first impressions matter](http://www.forbes.com/sites/nickmorgan/2014/06/10/why-do-first-impressions-matter/#11aa29759da7) and you've got to be unique. I thought, "down the road, the $41 won't matter". And, from the experience, it won't. In an effort to stand out and be different, I had to _do_. And, I think you should too. 

Take the action now and get better in the meantime. Progress will be made down the road. 

...oh, and here are the cards. Tiny, right?
