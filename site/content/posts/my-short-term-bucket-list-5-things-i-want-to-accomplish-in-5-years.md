  We’re coming up on an important highlight of the Henry Household —

  Gracelyn is one year away from Kindergarten.

  Jonah is one year away from Preschool.

It’s definitely an upsetting time, but Whitney and I know that we need to start being the parents that raise our kids in the best environment that we can provide. So, for this year, we’ve decided to keep Gracelyn at home and teach her. She’s really excited to go to school, but we want to see how far we can take her learning skills by that time.

For Jonah, he’s Gracelyn’s greatest pal. They play together and definitely learn a lot from one another.

All this being said I’ve been thinking a lot about what Jonah’s going to do if we send his best friend to school, and what does the next five years look like for us?

Are the kids going to be homeschooled?

Will they be safe in a public school environment?

What will be our own personal and business achievements in the next five years?

These are thought-provoking questions! So, I’m listing five things that I hope to accomplish by the year 2021. And, no, I’m not putting a month on it, because that way I have until the end of the year!

**\#1 Travel Outside Of The United States**

I’m 28 years old and have never left the U.S. The world around us is continually changing – sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worst. If we can at least make it to another country before more evil conquers the Earth, that’d be a great thing! A place like Germany or Italy sounds nice. Much of my family on my dad’s side have Italian genes, so I’d love to see where I came from.

According to a recent traveler’s checklist I looked at, it looks like we’ll definitely need to check a bunch!

**\#2 Continue to Run A Successful Business**

Running a successful business is no easy feat. Not only does it take determination, struggles, and roller coaster emotions, but it’s a long-term gig.

I’m now running MP Media Marketing locally with clients in video marketing and web design. There are so many obstacles I know we’ll have to overcome in order to succeed. But, I’m really optimistic from articles that state business failures are declining.

Hopefully by September 2021, I’m writing another article about the next 5 years and goals for the company.

**\#3 Write Two Non-Fiction Books**

There’s one thing that my experience has taught me – there’s someone out there that would be interested in my story. It’s the same way many of us enjoy reading autobiographies of famous people like Steve Jobs or even just people that lived long ago. There’s always going to be another person in the world you’re interested in – either their story, personality or just some of their achievements. I honestly think we have a story worth telling.

In my head, planning to have two non-fiction books written is not impossible. In fact, like I mentioned in [my previous post](http://masteringpurpose.com/my-start-to-mastering-purpose/), I’ve got the majority of the first one done, so finishing that one and moving to the next should help give me a head-start!

**\#4 Own A Rental Property**

I know that in order to increase wealth and establish good roots with income, it’s important to diversify. I think that can also go with any business. Finding different revenue streams will help with slowly building a good portfolio of strategies.

We’re in a good position with our current home to make a profit should we decide to leave. And, although that’s not happening anytime soon, once the family gets bigger, it would be nice to have our home as a rental with great tenants.

One thing I learned from a past colleague is that I want to have a maintenance company that watches over the property. I’m okay with paying a percentage; plus, that’s what they’re good at, not me!

**\#5 Live A Passive Income Lifestyle**

I know many of you out there don’t technically understand the passive income jargon, but basically, it’s a way to guarantee freedom in your life. Imagine the possibilities of putting systems into place that allow automation to happen.

This is a definite goal because I know that our lives would be forever changed. It seems there are too many opportunities online to pass up, and it’d be great to finally see the reward of working many hours to be able to make our own schedule, tell our story to the world, and travel. Plus, how awesome would it be to make money while we’re traveling!

It’s taken many years of my life to actually think of the “Where do you see yourself in 5 years” question.

For the kids, that means they will be eight and nine! Now, that’s sad.

Anyway, take care and until the next one.
