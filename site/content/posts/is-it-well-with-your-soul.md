  There's a song I heard recently, Even If by MercyMe.


  The song talks about how if all it takes is a little faith to move a mountain,
  that’s fine because a little faith is all [he] has.


  At one point, there’s a line that says, “it is well with my soul”.


  At this moment today, I realized a quick switch of words could determine how
  that line is heard.

One person hears the way it’s written and another person might hear: is it well with my soul?



At least that’s what I heard today.



The funny thing is that I’ve heard this song a dozen or more times before. Not once have I switched the two words to hear an entirely new perspective.



And so the question remains…



…is it well with your soul?
