## How To Find Purpose and Do What You Love

This is not an easy question.

I truly believe that there are so many people struggling with this right now and don't know what they are doing in life.

They are living on cruise-control with no plan.

They are drifting along their way with no intention of steering in another direction.

They truly feel that they are on the correct path, but maybe they're in it for the wrong reasons.

Life is such a puzzling and interesting thing to understand. We are all only here for such a short while, but sometimes feel that we just can't get everything under control.

Here's where purpose comes in.

One of my favorite quotes:

> “The meaning of life is to find your gift. The 
>
> _purpose _
>
> of life is to give it away.” ―Pablo Picasso.

Read that again.

The _meaning _of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away.

Pretty trivial, isn't it?

Yet we go about our day, waking up only to go right back to bed feeling that we've accomplished absolutely nothing.

Cue purpose.

_You _have that. A _purpose_.

There is something you are good at. More than good, probably exceptional. And, it is your job to find it, use it, and share it to others.

In fact, if you are not using it here on the Earth, it's actually hurting someone else in their life.

You see, there are certain people that need to hear your story. And, hear it from you.

The way that you would tell it, not someone else. Because that's how you were designed.

**Part 1: Finding Your Purpose**

This could be an entire book, but let's keep it brief for this post. You need to really dive deep on this one.

What is the one thing that you can talk to anybody about for hours?

I heard it once put, _what makes you forget to poop_?

There is something you have been interested in for probably most of your life and maybe have not realized it yet.

It can be a hobby, a full-time career, a part-time job, or just a skill.

But, you have to find it.

What happens if you don't?

Well, there will be this emptiness inside of you, as if something were missing completely from your soul.

Yeah, that's right. Not just inside of you, but your soul.

There's a constant yearning for something else, something better for you.

I say better for you because it's not going to work for someone else. In fact, some other people will think you're crazy.

**Part 2: Do What You Love**

There's a big difference between doing something that you are good/great at or doing something that you love and also are good/great at.

Here's an example: if there's a task that is done every day, no matter who does it, that person is going to get better at what they are doing.

There's something in the human brain that wants us to be efficient after doing something repetitive.

Sahaf from his IQ productivity blog says,

> "The ultimate goal when focusing on efficiency is to reduce wasted time, energy, and sometimes even money."

So, just because you are good at something doesn't mean that's what your purpose is or that it's what you were called to do.

This is the whole motive behind this blog, _Mastering Purpose_.

We never truly master it, because we're always trying.

**Quick note:** in my upcoming podcast interview with Stephen Shedletsky, we discuss this further. Stay tuned for that!

But, it's also important to find what you love to do. And keep doing it for the rest of your life.

The thing that happens when you put the love with purpose is that in the times of discouragement, you keep the _why _in your head.

The reason _why _you continue to wake up every day and fight for what you want.

The _why _behind the constant struggles you push to overcome.

Your purpose has the ability to overcome things you never thought possible.

And, it helps you connect to your true self. The person you _really _want to be.

Anyone can create muscle memory, but it's up to you to love what you do while doing it.

**Part 3: The Christian Part**

Scripture that relates here:

> "Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms."
> 1 Peter 4:10

We each have a gift (and purpose) and should use it accordingly. It's important to remember how God will use you.

**What to Do When You Can't Find Your Purpose?**

Keep looking!

It's not going to hurt to keep looking to fuel the fire inside.

It doesn't matter your age, your status, your career, your relationships, nothing.

What matters is that you don't let yourself down thirty or forty years from now knowing that you could have done better.

Here are 5 things people have regretted on their deathbed:

* _**I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.**_
* _**I wish I hadn't worked so hard.**_
* _**I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings.**_
* _**I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.**_
* _**I wish that I had let myself be happier.**_

[Source](http://www.businessinsider.com/5-things-people-regret-on-their-deathbed-2013-12) for those statements.

Notice that **no one** mentioned they wish they had another car, or that they wished to have a bigger house, or that they wished to have more followers on social media.

This is why it is both _crucial and critical_ (I'm not sure which word is best here!) to keep looking. And chances are that if you've been searching for a long time, you're a lot closer than you realize.

You are closer if you've been looking because you know what your purpose **is not.**

**Perfect Books to Read for Purpose Seeking**

[Rick Warren: The Purpose Driven Life](http://purposedriven.com/books/pdlbook/)

The Purpose Driven Life answers the following questions:

* The Question of Existence: Why am I alive?
* The Question of Significance: Does my life matter?
* The Question of Purpose: What on earth am I here for?

[Victor J. Strecher: Life on Purpose](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062409607/life-on-purpose/)

_Life on Purpose_ explores the incredible connection between purposeful living and the latest scientific evidence on quality of life and longevity.

It draws on ancient and modern philosophy, literature, psychology, evolutionary biology, genetics, and neuroscience.

If you'd like to listen to others' stories about their purpose, feel free to start listening to the [Mastering Purpose podcast](https://masteringpurpose.com/podcast-intro/). I get the privilege of interviewing people in their everyday lives living with purpose.

You're the best. Thanks for being here.
